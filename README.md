Platerformer Game Showcasing Experment with Sprite Mask and Make Sprites VIsible For Selected Entities

Masked Platformer is a 2D platform game that plays entirely in the dark â€” but instead of using light, it uses a sprite mask to control visibility.
Only a small masked area around the player is visible, creating a sense of mystery and tension as you explore the level.
Navigate carefully, avoid hidden obstacles, and find your way to the goal using only what you can see through the mask.
